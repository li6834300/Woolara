                <h2>Where Our Cashmere Comes From</h2>
                <p class="story-intro">Our fibers are collected from goats raised in the pristine highlands of Inner Mongolia.</p>
                <p>The Alashan Plateau and Ordos region provide a unique climate — with harsh winters and soft, dry summers — that results in longer, finer undercoats producing some of the world's softest cashmere.</p>
                <p>We exclusively use hand-combed fibers, harvested during the natural molting season to ensure no stress to the animals and maintain the highest fiber quality.</p>
